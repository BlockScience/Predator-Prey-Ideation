This folder showcases how to do reverse engineering with the aid of Obsidian. The steps followed were:

1. Port all relevant code into the "Legacy Code Review"
2. Create the folder of "MSML Scaffold" and start to link pieces of the legacy code files to their counterparts in an MSML scaffold
3. A second "MSML Scaffold 2" folder was created and copied over from "MSML Scaffold" with a canvas for organizing the wirings so that it could be refined (this can be done in one folder normally but for illustrative purposes was broken out)
